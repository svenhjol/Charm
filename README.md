# Charm for Minecraft 1.21

Charm is a Minecraft mod using the [Fabric loader](https://fabricmc.net/) that adds over 70 small tweaks, quality of life improvements and features that stick to the theme of the vanilla game without changing core gameplay.
All Charm features are able to be turned on and off using the extensive configuration file. Some features that do change gameplay are disabled by default.
